## Usage
 
MeG offers an extra layer of protection and support, covering everything from ridesharing, to dating, or just simply going for a stroll after dark on campus. Leverage features such as the Panic Button! for instance access to 911 services, and even go as far as inputting your Tinder date’s bio and sending that data out to your predetermined Emergency Contacts. You can even enter in a destination address, and have your Emergency Contacts notified if you breach pre-set parameters to where you’re supposed to be at.
